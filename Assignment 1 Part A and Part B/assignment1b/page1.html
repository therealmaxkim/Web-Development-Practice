				<h1 class="title">Problem Description</h1>
				<p>Given a string s that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can perform at most k operations on that string.</p>
				<p>In one operation, you can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character.</p> 
				<p>Find the length of the longest sub-string containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.</p>
				<p>Note: Both the string's length and k will not exceed 10^4.</p>

				<h1 class="title">Examples</h1>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-3">
						<p>Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2</p>
						<p>Output: 4</p>
						<p>Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-3">
						<p>Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1</p>
						<p>Output: 4</p>
						<p>Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA". The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.</p>

				<ol>
					<li>You can perform AT MOST K operations. so you can do 0 to k replacements.</li>
					<li>The longest subsequence must be consecutive.</li>
					<li>Think of how you would solve if k=1 and go from there.</li>

				<div>
					<h2>Idea 1: DP </h2>
					<p>If you can only change 1, then DP solution: at each index, what is the longest identical subsequence? Include the letter that it has and its length. Compare if you make a character shift at this index versus doing it earlier.</p>
					<p>Could you change the representation of the elements? Convert each string to a letter followed by repetitions : ABABAAAA = [A1, B1, A1, B1, A4] then check if changing the current index to adjacent letters will increase length </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Idea 2: Sliding window</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Initialize a dictionary that maps alphabet characters to zero </li>
						<li>Initialize L and R pointers </li>
						<li>Expand R until violate K</li>
						<li>When do you move L ? only if you used up all of your K</li>
						<li>when do you move R (expand window)? when majority of characters are same and you have K left over. </li>
					</ol>
					<p>length of window = R-L+1. The max number of same letters = number of k violations.</p>
					
					<p>maxCount = largest count of a single, unique character in the current window. The main equation is: end-start+1-maxCount</p>
					<p>When end-start+1-maxCount == 0, then then the window is filled with only one character When end-start+1-maxCount > 0, then we have characters in the window that are NOT the character that occurs the most. end-start+1-maxCount is equal to exactly the # of characters that are NOT the character that occurs the most in that window. Example: For a window "xxxyz", end-start+1-maxCount would equal 2. (maxCount is 3 and there are 2 characters here, "y" and "z" that are not "x" in the window.)</p>
					<p>We are allowed to have at most k replacements in the window, so when end-start+1-maxCount > k, then there are more characters in the window than we can replace, and we need to shrink the window.</p>
					<p>If we have window with "xxxy" and k = 1, that's fine because end-start+1-maxCount = 1, which is not > k. maxLength gets updated to 4. But if we then find a "z" after, like "xxxyz", then we need to shrink the window because now end-start+1-maxCount = 2, and 2 > 1. The window becomes "xxyz".</p>
